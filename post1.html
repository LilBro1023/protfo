            <h2>Life</h2>
            <p>Posted by Ethan Martinez Blair on October 3rd, 2023</p>
            <p>Life has been so fast recently. Memories have been flying by, staying and going. It's been a good year so far. Enjoying myself and spending time with those I care about. I have liked being back at college since it has given me time to reflex and also focus on my path in school. Being away for so long I almost forgot about the path that I chose. Being able to come back and start coding and writing has made me miss it all over again.</p>

            <p>Working all summer has been an interesting ride so far. Its taken up so much free time that I just feel so tired after I leave. I end up working out after so that I can still keep my body healthy and fit. For the longest time I was on and off with working out so it's nice to come back in and still have some of the strength I built up last time. Speaking of doing stuff after work I now get to see all my home town friends again which I think has been the greatest refresher. I'm hoping that by next summer I will also have an intership so I can finally apply my skills and everything I have learned so far from college.</p>

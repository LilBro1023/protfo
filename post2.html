            <h2>Food</h2>
            <p>Posted by Jane Smith on August 15th, 2023</p>
            <p>Cooking is something I have been up to a lot recently. Being able to final learn how to cook has been one of the most useful skills. I am able to spend less money on items at the store and make them in my house and enjoy cooking the meal hands on to my liking. I get to add my own seasonings and flavors to where my food taste exactly how I want to. I have been mostly learning to cook from my mom and dad. My mom has been cooking ever since she was younger so getting to learn her style has been great.</p>
